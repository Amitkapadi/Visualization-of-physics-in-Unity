WHAT WE MUST DO TO USE THOSE METHODS:

First we must add namespace to your script:

Method can be invoked from OnDrawGizmos() and OnDrawGizmosSelected():

Classes to visualize methods you can find in this folder:

In this folder you can find example scenes with examples of uses of classes.

How to use examples?
1. Choice a scene with interesting methods. 
2. Open scene window (gizmos are places in different places in space, so from scene window its much easier to find them)
3. Activate choisen gameObject with right script and open script
